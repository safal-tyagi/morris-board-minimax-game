## Getting Started

- Extract ProjectAI to local directory
- Install java and add to system path, if not already. 
- .\bin folder contains compiled files

- If you wish, to compile the source, you will need to install JDK (jdk-14.0.2 or higher) and add [YOUR_JDK_PATH]\bin to system path.
- Run .\src\compile.bat to generate .class file in .\bin folder
- Change directory to .\bin. Now you can run any of the xyzGame.class or xyzOpening.class using following syntax
    - java xyzOpening board1.txt board2.txt 2
    - java xyzGame board3.txt board4.txt 3

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `bin`: the folder to maintain compiled java classes
